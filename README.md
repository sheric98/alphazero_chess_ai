# alphazero_chess_ai

This project trains a neural network to play chess using following the AlphaZero implementation.
Run the `main.py` file to start training.

## Training
You can either start with a supervised learning phase (as the original AlphaGo model does) or go straight into reinforcement learning.
To play against the model, you need to first say no to both training phases and then say yes to playing against the cpu.
Currently move inputs need to be in uci form.
